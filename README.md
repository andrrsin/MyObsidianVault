# MyVault
Obsidian vault of my notes for university from the 3rd year including my erasmus in Kaunas. It also includes some other notes I have. Feel fre to explore and use them. 

**ATTENTION:** I recommend cloning the repository and accesing it with Obsidian to use it properly and see evreything how it should be.

## University
The Universidad folder shows the main archive called University. This archive contains Obsidian Links to every other subject. And the contents are divided in extra, theory and laboratory. It has a robust structure of hashtags that can be used to navigate through contents.
