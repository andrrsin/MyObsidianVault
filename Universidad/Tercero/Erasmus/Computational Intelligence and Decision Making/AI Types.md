#Theory/AI 

There are 3 different main types of AI:
- [[Supervised Learning]]: It has a simple way of working, a model is created, then it is evaluated and from there conclusions are taken.
- [[Unsupervised Learning]]: learning patterns without explicit feedback.
- [[Reinforcement Learning]]:â€“ learning from a series of reinforcements (rewards or punishments)
