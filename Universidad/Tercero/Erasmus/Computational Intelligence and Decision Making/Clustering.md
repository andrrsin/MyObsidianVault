# What is Clustering
It is the process of partitioning the whole dataset based on similarities that is the distance. Finding the characteristics the data have in common so they can be put in unkown groups. 

Some applications it has is detecting unkown groups as mentioned beforehand, data reduction tasks such as compression or noise smoothing.

# Types of Clustering methods
There are different types of clustering the studied in this subject is K-means and Graph theory, however there are all these types:
- **Hierarchical methods**
	- **Agglomeration Clustering:** start with a singleton clusters and merge with respect to the similarity criterion
	- **Divise Clustering:** start with all elements in one cluster and divide in several partitions in each step
- **K-Means methods**
- **[[Decision Trees |Graph theory methods]]**

There are some Unsupervised and Supervised Techniques which use Clustering, such as:
- [[Decision Trees]]
- [[Soft Assignment K-means]]
- [[K-means algorithm]]
