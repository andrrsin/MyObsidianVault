# Introduction to expert systems
>Expert Systems - An intelligent computer program that uses knowledge and inference procedures to solve problems that are difficult enough to require significant human expertise for the solution.
> - *Dr. Edward Feigenbaum*

An expert system can be separated in 3 parts:
- **Knowledge Base:** Factual and heuristic knwoledge in form of if-else-then, it is manipulated by knowledge engineer.
- **Inference Mechanism:** Allows the manipulation of the knowledge for solving problemms using constraints and inheritance, retrieval of data, inference rules...
- **User Interface:** Provides interaction between the user and the system

Some properties this ES have are the fact of the AI not being based on learning, it is accesible 24/7, can explain some recommendations, and it is hard coded to solve specific problems.
