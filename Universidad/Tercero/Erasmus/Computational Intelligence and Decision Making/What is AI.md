# Definition of an AI

> Artificial Intelligence - systems that demonstrate intelligent behavior by analyzing
	its environment and making fairly independent decisions to achieve a goal.

There are multiple types of AI based on the "intelligence" they have:
- **Weak AI:** It has a narrow scope, It simulates a human in a really specific task, doing it really well.
- **Strong AI:** It has the level of intelligence of a human
- **Super AI:** This type of AI is better than a human in knowledge and ability.

Currently the most common case is Weak AI an dwe have been able to create Strong AI such as ==ChatGPT==.

# Layers of an AI
An AI can be described with 3 layers:

1. The Artificial Intellligence level enables the model to beheve in a way depending the situation, this is accomplished with if-else rules, logic or decision trees or ==Machine Learning==
2. Machine Learning is an AI that implies training it to get better in a context without explicitly programming it.
3. Deep Learning is training the machine using multi layered neural networks.
