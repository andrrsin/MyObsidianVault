#Theory/Networks  
An Enterprise Service Bus(ESB) is a middleware used to connect large systems together. Note that ESB are large and expensive pieces of software. They shoudl be used in big systems.

Internals of a ESB are:
1.  Protocol adapters translate the communications between components
2.  Quality of service (QoS):
    -   QoS Prioritization subsystem is responsible for ensuring that higher priority communications are allocated the necessary bandwidth before lower priority communications.
    -   QoS Caching subsystem allows caching of streaming communications.
    -   QoS Restrictions subsystem allows filtering out undesired portions of communications streams or denying communications based on a configurable set of rules.
3.  Component registry is used to track what systems and at which versions are connected to ESB. This is used to ensure version compatibility between the systems connected via ESB.
4.  Message broker is used to store and route non-streaming (discrete) communication streams. Acts as a buffer that compensates jumps in system load. Stores communications while target systems are inoperable. Allows examining all communications traveling between connected systems.
5.  Event generator is used to generate events based on inspection of communications traveling via ESB.
6.  Rule engine is used to execute workflows or batch-jobs based on events generated by event generator or environmental conditions (for example, time of day).
7.  Workflows subsystem allows executing _workflows_. 
8.  Batch jobs subsystem is used to run common batch jobs, defined either via scripts or workflows.
9.  Transaction coordinator in ESBs is used to provided distributed transaction support and to translate between commonly used distributed transaction protocols.
10.  ESB clustering support subsystems are responsible for connecting ESB instances into clusters for high-availability and scalability.
11.  ESBs also often come with components that provide common services to connected subsystems. For example with and integrated mail server.
12.  If several connected systems support conceptually matching administration and configuration tasks, these can be merged into single administration and configuration interface provided by the ESB.
